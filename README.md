# Flask Application Structure

This document provides an overview of the structure of the Flask application.

The application is organized into several modules, each responsible for different
aspects of the application. Below is a brief description of each module:

1. `app/__init__.py`:
    - Initializes the Flask application and its extensions.
    - Sets up the configuration, database, and API.

2. `app/utils/__init__.py`:
    - Contains utility functions and classes that can be reused across the application.

3. `app/db.py`:
    - Initializes the SQLAlchemy database instance.

4. `app/routes/__init__.py`:
    - Initializes the routes for the application by importing and registering API resources.

5. `instance/config.py`:
    - Contains the configuration class for the Flask application, including the database URI.

Each module is designed to keep the code organized and maintainable, allowing for easy
scalability and readability.
